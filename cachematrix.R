## This file contains two functions that saves computational power for the costly computation of
## calculating an inverse matrix. The first function allows the user to create a special matrix
## object that can cache it inverse. The second function calculates then checks whether or not
## the value of a given matrix has been calculated. If so, it returns that value. If not, it
## goes through the process of calculating the matrix. 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
i<-NULL
  
## Pairs the matrix with a value i for storing
set <-function(y){ 
	x <<- y	
 	i <<-  NULL
}
   
## Gets the function in question from the local environment   
get <- function () { 
	x
}

## Solves for the inverse of the function
setInverse <- function(solve){

	i <<- solve(x)

 }
 ## Calls the calculated inverse based on the value i, bringing together the three other functions created in the function using the list command
getInverse <- function () { 
 i
}
 list (set, get, setInverse,getInverse)
}

}


## Use cache to get the inverse of the matrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

i <- getInverse(x) ##Stores the value of the martix in question as i with the command 


if(!is.null(i)){ 
	## Gets and returns the cached value
	message("getting cached data")
	return(i)
}
## Calculates the inverse in the event the inverse is NOT stored in the cache
	data <- x$get()
	i<-solve(data,...)
	x$setInverse(i)
## Returns the value of the calculated inverse
i
}
## Thanks for taking the time to evaluate! Hope it made sense!
